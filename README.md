# Midterm-Project
This is a reposting of my Midterm Project, for reference. The original commit date was the day that it was due. 

Inventory Clerk:
Username: inventoryclerk
Password: password

Manager:
Username: manager
Password: password

Guest:
Username: guest
Password: password

After executing the single PHP file, there is an option to log-in as an existing user, and another option to create a new user.  If the first option is selected, the user is prompted for a valid username and password.  The username for each user is simply the name of the user ('inventoryclerk’, ‘manager’, ‘guest’), and the password for each user is simply ‘password’.  If I can provide anything else, please let me know.
